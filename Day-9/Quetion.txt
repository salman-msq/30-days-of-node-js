d. All of the above

Answer:
d. All of the above

Reason:
Express.js is the most popular web framework or module for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs and building a backend from-scratch for an application in Node.js can be tedious and time consuming. So, developers can save time and focus on other important tasks using the web frameworks like Express.js.

Body-parser is an npm library used to process data sent through an HTTP request body.
